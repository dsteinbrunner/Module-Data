Release history for Module-Data

{{$NEXT}}
 [Internals]
 - Rework module discovery to be optimistic, check %INC if its there already, and if it is, report where it was found, otherwise, ask Path::ScanINC to tell us where it is WITHOUT loading it. This will hopefully be usefull in many cases allowing us to detect module availability without needing the compile/memory overheads of actually loading said modules
